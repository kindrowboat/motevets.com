I was originally turned on to [hexaflexagons] while watching a [video by
vihart]. I’ve since become a tad obsessed.  My partner, [Jane Meredith], and I
created [Hexaflexago], a hexaflexagon template generator.

# Features
- Generates a printable trihexaflexagon template
- Upload up the three images; Hexaflexago splices them into the template for
  you

# Technical Notes

Written with:
- React.js using [create-react-app]
- the vanilla [SVG standard]

# What’s Next?

There are some improvements I’d like to make to Hexaflexago eventually.
- enable users to crop added images *(currently Hexaflexago letterboxes images
  that are not regular hexagons)*
- add documentation on how to fold the hexaflexagon template
- support adding six images to make hexahexaflexagons

I’m also currently working with [Littoral Press] to make hexaflexagon business
cards.  Here’s a prototype:
